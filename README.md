# Business Card HTML/CSS Project

This project involves creating a responsive business card using HTML and CSS. The business card will include a picture, a one-liner introduction, and links to your LinkedIn or GitHub accounts. The design will be customized using CSS, with additional functionality such as a border change on hover.

This project has three levels of difficulty: Mild, Spicy, and Dangerous.

## Mild
Create a business card layout using HTML and CSS. The card will consist of the following elements:

An image (your picture) to the left of the card
A one-liner introduction about yourself
Links to your LinkedIn or GitHub accounts to the right of the card
Customize the styling of each element using CSS.

## Spicy
Add an animation to the business card using CSS. When a user hovers over the business card, the border of the card should change. You have creative freedom in deciding how the border changes.

## Dangerous
Make the business card responsive for different screen sizes, specifically focusing on mobile devices like iPhones. Implement the following:

Create a desktop view with the elements arranged as in the Mild version.
Create a new view for iPhones where all elements are stacked vertically on top of each other for a better mobile experience.
You can determine the CSS styles needed to achieve these views and make the business card accessible and visually appealing on various screen sizes.

Feel free to customize the project with your own design choices, colors, fonts, and additional elements.

Instructions:

Fork or clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the business card.
Customize the HTML content and CSS styles in the respective files to personalize your business card.
Use media queries and CSS rules to make the card responsive for different screen sizes.
Experiment with CSS animations to achieve the hover effect for the border.
Note: This project is designed to help you practice your HTML and CSS skills, as well as learn about responsive design and animations. Have fun and get creative with your designs!
